# CSE-106-Assignments

This repository contains solutions for CSE-106 assignments. Each file demonstrates key C++ concepts:

## BasicCourseManagement.cpp
Implements a simple course management system using object-oriented programming. Features include:
- Adding and removing courses
- Registering and managing students
- Displaying course and student information
- Demonstrates use of classes, encapsulation, and basic data structures
- **OOP Features:** Classes, encapsulation, abstraction

## Fractions.cpp
Defines a `Fraction` class for handling mathematical fractions. Key features:
- Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on fractions
- Simplification and normalization of fractions
- Input and output operations for fractions
- Demonstrates operator overloading and class design
- **OOP Features:** Classes, encapsulation, operator overloading, and  constructors/destructors

## OperatorOverloading.cpp
Showcases operator overloading in C++ with custom classes. Includes:
- Examples of overloading arithmetic and comparison operators
- Intuitive usage of custom types with standard operators
- Demonstrates best practices for operator overloading
- **OOP Features:** Classes, operator overloading, encapsulation, and polymorphism
